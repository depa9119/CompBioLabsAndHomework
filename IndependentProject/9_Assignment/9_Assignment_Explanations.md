### Subsets
#### By Species
Two species are studied: _Permyscus maniculatus_ and _Peromyscus leucopus_ (Species = 'PM' and 'PL' respectively).
Species are seperated due to inherently different characteristcs, body length to tail length is the only physical difference measured as provided by the data set. PM has as 2:1 tail to body ratio compared to PL which has a 1:1 ratio

#### By Gender and Age
*Peromyscus* species have sexually dimorphic size characteristcs 
Pregnant females will also be inherently heavier due to extra weight from pups. As weight of mother only (i.e. subtracting weight of pups) cannot be determined from the provided data set, females who are labeled as pregnant (Pregnant = 'Y') or maybe pregnant (Pregnant = 'Y?' & '?') are removed from dataset.

Size varies depending on the age of the individual. However due to the limitations of mark and recapture, absolute age is not completely accurate using capture dates only. Thus individuals are grouped into age categories using fur molting characteristics as described by Gottschang, J. (1956).

Adults- Oldest
SubAdults- 2.9 Older
SubAdults- 2.6
SubAdults- 2.3 Younger
Juveniles- Youngest

#### Number of Observations: abbr No.Obsv
After tallying observations within each subset for subadults, it was determined not enough data points were present to justify analysis for each stage, thus all subadult stages are grouped into single category instead of three individual categories.
