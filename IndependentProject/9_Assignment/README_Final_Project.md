## Biological Question
Which demographics are the most at risk for severe intestinal parasite infection? Are there more severe infection in the strongest, healthiest, best fit mice because they might be a better source of nutrition? Or, is there more severe infection in the weakest, sickest, least fit mice because their immune systems are ill-fitted to fight off infection.

## Context
Parasite-host interactions have been a commonality in all types of organisms. Specifically, intestinal parasites (aka endoparasites) have been undergoing co-evolution with their preferred hosts. This specific relationship imitates an ongoing arms race where hosts become more adept at defending and repelling parasites while simultaneously parasites evolve to counteract said defense. Humans are not exempt from parasite-host interactions and evidence of intestinal parasites in ancient humans is found throughout history, so much so that the endoparasites can be tracked along the same migration routes as nomadic prehistoric humans (Goncalves et. al 2003).

Despite that parasites are old-enemies of the human race, they are still prevalent in modern human socity which can cause a varied and long-term number of health issues. Intestinal helminthes and protozoa are some of the most common, especially in lower socioeconomic areas (Haque, 2007) and the  CDC estimates 880 million children worldwide are currently infected with intestinal worms (WHO reports). Infection in a single individual not only affects their health but can affect their community by contributing to a ‘Negative Spiral.’ The inherent illness in the human host caused by endoparasites can lead to to energy loss, reduced productivity, thus continuous poverty within the community. As a result, intestinal parasites can contribute to overall worsening socioeconomic and political instability of the community creating a ‘Negative Spiral’ (Schaible & Kaufmann 2007). A single instance of infection might cause permanent damage and long-term consequences within the digestive tract among other body systems even after treatment (Hallieze & Buret 2013). 

Due to the high prevalence and threat posed by intestinal parasites, it is important to understand the relationship between hosts and endoparasites so as to provide better information and data to provide better treatment for at-risk populations. However, as ethical and logistical challenges provide limits for human experiments and treating human parasites, this research uses _Peromyscus leucopus_ and _Peromyscus maniculatus_ as model organisms. Wild _Peromyscus_ are ideal models due to their high abundance in multiple types of different habitats with a previously well plotted genome and descriptive data so as to provide insight concerning natural variation and adaption to different environments and stresses (Bedford and Hoekstra 2015).

## Methods

### Source
 Mountain Lake Biological Station (MLBS) between the summer months of years 2016-2018. The Mountain Lake Biological Station is located in the Jefferson National Forest surrounding Pembroke Virginia (37.375654° -80.522140°). The research was directed by the Graham Group at Princeton University (Sarah Budischak; Collaborators: Andrea Graham, Courtney Thomason).
 
 ### Original Purpose of Data
The original experiment, reffered to as the 'Mouse Lab' focused on co-infection in wild populations of _Peromyscus maniculatus_ and _Peromyscus leucopus_. Specifically, the relationship between simultanous infections of Hanta virus and endoparasites and their effect on the host immune system.  Graham lab research questions include: 1. Why are hosts prone to producing overzealous responses that cost proteins and may actually even cause disease? 2. How does immunity interact with resource limitation to control parasite replication? 3. How should the immune system multitask with different types of simultaneous infections? Overall, Hanta virus (pro-inflammatory) and endoparasites (anti-inflammatory) invoke opposite types of immune responses so how does the host immune system choose when to switch from one to the other to maintain best health?

Mouse Lab research remains unpublished as blood samples, identifying virulence of Hanta virus, are waiting to be processed. However data is owned by the Graham Lab so any publishment requires prior permissions.

### Type of Data
Format: 'xlsx' file provided
Size: 2.2 MB, 2600 captures covering 2016-2018 summer months
Inconsistencies: Due to the nature of wild capture and release, data entry for each individual ranges from a single data point to data points spanning across multiple years. Thus, there is no standard number of data points for single indivduals as the target population is subject to uncontrollable factors such as predation, migration, etc.

### Data Collection
__Field Work__
Data collected from P. leucopus and P. maniculatus during the 2016-2018 summer months (June-August) are collected from eight total of field sites surrounding MLBS. The eight field sites occur in groups of two grids. The grids were named the following, Bear Cliffs, Hedwig, Pond, Spring (Figure 3). Each grid was sectioned into eight rows (listed A-BCI) with eight columns set perpendicular (numbered 1-8) creating a total of 64 cells each with an area of 10 feet squared (3.048 m2). All cells are marked with flags labeled with the corresponding number and letter (i.e. A3, F8). At the beginning of each field site sampling rotation, Sherman live aluminum traps (3” x 3.5” x 9”) are placed at all 64 cells in both grids at one location (i.e. Bear Cliffs #1 and Bear Cliffs #2). One Sherman live trap is laid per cell in each of the two grids before the start of a site sampling of the 2-3 day cycle and all traps are removed after sampling on the last day. During each day of the trapping cycle, the Sherman live traps are checked in the morning and are either replaced or refreshed. If the trap is to be replaced with a clean trap and fresh bait, it must be either be previously occupied (i.e. successful catch of P. leucopus or P. maniculatus or bycatch) or dirty (i.e. unsuccessful catch). 

If catches were successful, the mouse was examined for their physical condition. First catch of every _Peromyscus_ individual was randomly assigned to either Antihelminthic treatment or a sugar water control. Dosages of treatment/control are dependent on body weight at time of capture. Type of dosage is permanent since first assigned to the individual. Dosages given and measurements taken only once per two/three day trapping cycle. (Note: all handling of Peromyscus mice conducted with all relevant certification and permits as approved by IACUC.)

Fecal samples from successful Sherman live traps are collected into appropriate vials, weighed, and stored in Formalin for at least 24 hours in order to complete parasite counts in later lab work.  Sterile techinque and appropriate personal protective equipment was used for handling of fecal samples.

__Lab Work__
A fecal floatation test was conducted to prepare fecal samples for parasite load analysis. With a compound light microscope the number and types of parasites were identified and compared to fecal weight for overall ratio.

## My Use of Data
### Subsets
__By Species__
Two species are studied: _Permyscus maniculatus_ and _Peromyscus leucopus_ (Species = 'PM' and 'PL' respectively).
Species are seperated due to inherently different characteristcs, body length to tail length is the only physical difference measured as provided by the data set. PM has as 2:1 tail to body ratio compared to PL which has a 1:1 ratio

__By Gender and Age__
*Peromyscus* species have sexually dimorphic size characteristcs but BCI will account for inherent larger sizes of males so it is not neccessary to seperate species by gender.
Pregnant females will also be inherently heavier due to extra weight from pups. As weight of mother only (i.e. subtracting weight of pups) cannot be determined from the provided data set, females who are labeled as pregnant (Pregnant = 'Y') or maybe pregnant (Pregnant = 'Y?' & '?') are removed from dataset.

Size varies depending on the age of the individual. However due to the limitations of mark and recapture, absolute age is not completely accurate using capture dates only. Thus individuals are grouped into age categories using fur molting characteristics as described by Gottschang, J. (1956).

Adults- Oldest
SubAdults- 2.9 Older
SubAdults- 2.6
SubAdults- 2.3 Younger
Juveniles- Youngest

__Number of Observations: abbr No.Obsv__
After tallying observations within each subset for subadults, it was determined not enough data points were present to justify analysis for each stage of subadult. Thus all subadult stages are grouped into single category instead of three individual categories.

### Creation of BCI
Body Condition Index (BCI) or Scaled Mass Index (Mi) as described by Pieg et. al (2009) was calculated according to the given formula. BCI is important to describing health of the individual mice because similar to BMI in humans (Body Mass Index), BCI is a calculation of size with considerations to length of animal and weight of animal. Thus, confusions like long length but light weight is not inherently skewed to better or worse than a short length but heavy weight.

Average mean length for the entire species was applied to each individual. An adjusted mean length for each subset was not used. 
"The arithmetic mean or median of the linear body measure (L) for all sampled individuals make suitable L^0 values, but we emphasize that any value within the range of L observations can be used" ( Pieg et. al 2009).

## Results
**Notes**
parasite.egg.g = number of parasite eggs/oocysts per gram of feces. I.E. "Cocc.Egg.g" = Coccidia oocysts per gram of feces

**Statistical Tests**

Fit an analysis of Variance Model (aov) :
Model 1~ "Species_Independentvar_w.categorical_Age" : Model with interaction between categorical variable and predictor variable.

Anova: Comparison of both Models
Comparison of the two models to conclude if the interaction of the variables is in-significant. As the p-value is insignficant [Pr(>F) <0.05] dependent function will depend in a similar manner for all independent variables.

## Conclusions
Contrary to my initial expectations BCI will be affected by endoparasites and that a single demographic will have trends towards parasite infection, I found no evidence that niether Age nor Species have any significant relationship to parasite load (quantities of parasites) or parasite types (Coccidia, Nematodes, Cestodes). 

I expected to see a direct correlation between number of parasites and BCI. However, as seen in the data and in Graph1, there is no obvious trend between Endoparasites and BCI. In addition, there is no relationship between young age and increased parasite load as seen by no grouping of similar colors.
![Graph1.Zoom1.pdf](https://github.com/depa9119/CompBioLabsAndHomework/blob/master/IndependentProject/9_Assignment/Graph1.Zoom1.pdf)

Even though there was a insignificant relationship between any tested variables variables, there was a common stronger significance between Cestodes, Nematodes and Treatment (i.e. p values were less than 0.1 but greater than 0.05). This is not unexpected as treatment is anti-helminthic solution, but if treatment and thus reduction of nematode/cestode parasites does not reduce parasite load substantially so as to influence BCI (as the medication's original purpose) this might indicate that experimental protocal may be flawed. Despite this stronger relationship if still insignificant, no obvious trend in Graph2.
![Graph2.Zoom2.pdf](https://github.com/depa9119/CompBioLabsAndHomework/blob/master/IndependentProject/9_Assignment/Graph2.Zoom2.pdf)

However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. Specifically, due to the low number of individuals caught as juveniles and subadults in comparison adults issues corresponding to small sample size might influence data. Future research may focus on the trap and recapture of the youngest ages with modified protocol for shorter times for trapping between field sites to account for fast growth rate of young mice.
